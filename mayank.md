Improved Communication Processes
Business technology helps small businesses improve their communication processes. Emails, texting, websites and apps, for example, facilitate improved communication with consumers. Using several types of information technology communication methods enable companies to saturate the economic market with their message. Companies may also receive more consumer feedback through these electronic communication methods.

Technology also improves inter-office communication as well. For example, social intranet software gives employees a centralizes portal to access and update internal documents and contracts and relay relevant data to other departments instantly. These methods also help companies reach consumers through mobile devices in a real-time format.

Increased Employee Productivity
Small businesses can increase their employees' productivity through the use of technology. Computer programs and business software usually allow employees to process more information than manual methods. Business owners can also implement business technology to reduce the amount of human labor in business functions. This allows small businesses to avoid paying labor costs along with employee benefits.

Even fundamental business tech can have a major impact on employee performance. For example, by placing employee-performance appraisal information in an online framework, supervisors can easily create measurable goals for their employees to reach and sustain company objectives. Business owners may also choose to expand operations using technology rather than employees if the technology will provide better production output.

Broaden Customer Bases
Technology allows small businesses to reach new economic markets. Rather than just selling consumer goods or services in the local market, small businesses can reach regional, national and international markets. Retail websites are the most common way small businesses sell products in several different economic markets.
